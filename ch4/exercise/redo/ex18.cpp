/*
Write a program to solve quadratic equations. A quadratic equation is of the form
ax^2 + bx + c = 0 
If you donâ€™t know the quadratic formula for solving such an expression, do some 
research. Remember, researching how to solve a problem is often necessary 
before a programmer can teach the computer how to solve it. Use doubles for the user 
inputs for a, b, and c. Since there are two solutions to a quadratic equation, 
output both x1 and x2.
