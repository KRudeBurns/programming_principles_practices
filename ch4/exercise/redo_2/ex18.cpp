/*
18. Write a program to solve quadratic equations. A quadratic equation is of the form
ax2 + bx + c = 0
If you donâ€™t know the quadratic formula for solving such an expression, do some research. Remember, researching how
to solve a problem is often necessary before a programmer can teach the computer how to solve it. Use doubles for the
user inputs for a, b, and c. Since there are two solutions to a quadratic equation, output both x1 and x2.
