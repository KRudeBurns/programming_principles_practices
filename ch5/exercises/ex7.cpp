/*

Quadratic equations. To solve these, one uses the quadratic formula.
There is a problem, though: if b^2â€“4ac is less than zero, then it will fail. 

Write a program that can calculate x for a
quadratic equation. Create a function that prints out the roots of a 
quadratic equation, given a, b, c. When the program
detects an equation with no real roots, have it print out a message. 

How do you know that your results are plausible? 
Can you check that they are correct?
