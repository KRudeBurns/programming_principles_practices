10 Write a program that takes an operation followed by two 
operands and outputs the result. For example:
+ 100 3.14
* 4 5
Read the operation into a string called operation and use 
an if-statement to figure out which operation the user wants,
for example, if (operation=="+"). Read the operands into variables
 of type double. Implement this for operations called +, â€“, *, /, 
 plus, minus, mul, and div with their obvious meanings.
